**The data getting analyzed today is from the NYPD Shooting Incident Rate.We are provided with the perp and victim data for the past 15 years** 
**We will looking at the Gender vs Shooting Incident Rates and later predict crime rates for the next few years**

**Looking at the above data, there is no significant difference between data with respect to gender.**
**Crime against black community was at an all time high in all cases unfortunately.** 




```{r}
#Plotting shooting time over date
ggplot(relevant_data, aes(x=OCCUR_DATE, y=OCCUR_TIME)) + geom_point()

#Calculate and plot crime per year 
year_crime_data <- data.frame(table(relevant_data[["YEAR"]]))
ggplot(year_crime_data, aes(x=Var1, y=Freq)) + geom_point()

#Model the change in crime every year
mod_crime <- lm(Freq ~ as.numeric(Var1), data = year_crime_data)

#Predict expected numbers for 2021, 2022, and 2023
new.df <- data.frame(Var1=c(16,17,18))
crime_pred <- predict(mod_crime, new.df)
list(crime_pred)
```
There is a downward trend of crime in the past but it had more or less stabilized
but 2020 was an outlier as can be seen the ggplot. This can also be due to the fact that this analysis only captures the resolved incidents. 
Based on the data, there is still a downward trend for the next few years despite the outlier 2020. 

**This data used is biased for crimes that were resolved.** 
**If the perp was not found and the case is open (missing data),**
**it was removed from the data used above.**
**The other assumption was the gender differences which was shown to be not true.**
